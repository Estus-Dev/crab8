# CRAB-8

A CHIP-8 emulator written in Rust with a [Bevy Engine][] frontend.

## Note

This project is still under active development and does not yet pass all the tests or run example software. _(But it's getting there)_

It's also not cleaned up and using idiomatic Rust, my goal is to get the project to MVP as quickly as possible and then take a cleanup pass later.
